# Coffer App - Secure Blockchain Photo Sharing

## Project Overview

Coffer App is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to revolutionize the way users share photos on the blockchain. Leveraging the power of the Linea Testnet, Infura, Metamask SDK, and Truffle for deployment, this project addresses the challenge of secure and immutable photo sharing on the blockchain.

## Background

The project was submitted for the "Make a Dapp that slaps, No cap" bounty. In this bounty, we recognized the need for a blockchain-based solution to address the inherent issues with centralized photo-sharing platforms. By utilizing blockchain technology, we aim to provide users with a secure and trustless way to share their photos without relying on third-party intermediaries.

## Problem Statement

Traditional photo-sharing platforms often suffer from issues related to censorship, and centralization. Users are typically required to trust a single entity with their personal photos, leaving them vulnerable to data breaches and misuse. Coffer App aims to address these issues by allowing users to share photos securely on the blockchain. Users simply provide an address, and their photos are stored in an immutable and transparent manner.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Photo Sharing:** Users can upload and share photos on the blockchain without relying on a central authority.
- **Immutable Storage:** All shared photos are stored on-chain, ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized alterations.
- **Secure Access:** Metamask SDK integration provides users with secure access to the app, enhancing wallet security and user trust.
- **Linea Testnet:** The Linea Testnet infrastructure ensures a reliable and cost-effective environment for testing and deployment.
- **Scalability:** Future plans include making the app available on other blockchain networks to increase its reach and usability.

## Tech Stack

- **Solidity:** Smart contracts are written in Solidity to facilitate secure interactions on the blockchain.
- **Nextjs:** The user interface is built using React to provide an intuitive and responsive user experience.
- **JavaScript:** JavaScript is used for application logic and interaction with the blockchain.
- **IPFS:** InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is employed for efficient and decentralized file storage.
- **Metamask SDK:** Metamask SDK ensures secure wallet management and blockchain interactions.
- **Truffle:** Truffle is used for streamlined smart contract deployment and development.

## Future Plans

Our future plans for Coffer App include expanding its availability across multiple blockchain networks, making it a versatile and widely accessible solution for secure photo sharing. We aim to continuously improve the app's scalability, security, and user experience based on user feedback and evolving blockchain technologies.

Coffer App is not just a photo-sharing platform; it's a step towards a more decentralized and user-centric internet, where individuals have greater control over their data and privacy. With a strong foundation built on blockchain and innovative technologies, Coffer App is set to disrupt the way we share and protect our photos online.
